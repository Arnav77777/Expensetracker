Here are some additional functionalities you can add to your Expense Tracker project to make it more comprehensive and useful:

1. Delete Expense
Allow users to delete an expense from the list.

Steps:
Add a "Delete" button next to each expense in the viewexpense.html table.
Create a backend script (deleteexpense.php) to handle the deletion.
Update the frontend (viewexpense.js) to send a request to delete the expense and refresh the table.
2. Filter Expenses
Allow users to filter expenses by date range, category, or amount.

Steps:
Add a filter form in viewexpense.html with fields for date range, category, and amount.
Update the backend (viewexpense.php) to handle filter parameters.
Update the frontend (viewexpense.js) to send filter parameters and display the filtered results.
3. Export Expenses
Allow users to export their expenses as a CSV or Excel file.

Steps:
Add an "Export" button in viewexpense.html.
Create a backend script (exportexpenses.php) to generate a CSV file from the database.
Trigger the download when the user clicks the "Export" button.
4. User Profile Management
Allow users to update their profile information, such as username, email, and password.

Steps:
Add a "Profile" page (profile.html) with a form for updating user details.
Create a backend script (updateprofile.php) to handle profile updates.

5. Monthly Expense Summary
Provide users with a summary of their expenses for the current month, including total expenses and category-wise breakdown.

Steps:
Add a "Summary" section in dashboard.html.
Create a backend script (getsummary.php) to calculate the monthly summary.
Display the summary in the frontend using charts (e.g., pie chart or bar chart) with a library like Chart.js.
6. Budget Management
Allow users to set a monthly budget and track how much of it has been spent.

Steps:
Add a "Set Budget" feature in dashboard.html.
Create a backend script (setbudget.php) to save the budget in the database.

7. Recurring Expenses
Allow users to add recurring expenses (e.g., monthly subscriptions, rent).

Add a "Recurring Expenses" section in addexpense.html.
Create a backend script (addrecurringexpense.php) to save recurring expenses.
Automatically add recurring expenses to the database at the start of each month using a cron job or scheduled task.
